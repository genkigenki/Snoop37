/* The SMK-37 Pro's pitch wheel as a bend (main.c smk_wheels; voice.c applies it to the selected synth track):
 * raw ADC reading -> 1/4096 semitone, +-SMK_PW_ST semitones. Self-calibrating: the rest (centre) is the first
 * reading, the range grows to what the wheel has reached, a dead band of SMK_PW_DEAD around the centre.
 * While the wheel rests in the dead band the centre follows a slow drift, at most one step per SMK_PW_DRIFT_MS
 * (in time, not in calls: the main loop calls this thousands of times a second, and a centre that moves that
 * fast is dragged along by a slow touch of the wheel; the spring then brings the wheel back to its real rest,
 * outside the dragged dead band, and a bend stays on whatever track is selected). No hardware here: the host
 * tests (tests/smk_wheel_test.c) run it. */
